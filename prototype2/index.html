                <h2>The Making of Yearless...</h2>
                <h3>...Formally known as "Pet's With People's Names"</h3>
                <p>Birthed from the ashes of the prostate exam of pop punk, Pets With People Names, Yearless is here to make
                    you sad, so very, very sad.</p>

                <p>The band released their first EP, This House Makes Me Homesick, under their new name in October 2017 and
                    has been picking up steam ever since. In early 2018, Jake Smith assumed his role as bassist, and Hagan
                    moved strictly to vocals, allowing him to create a more “unique” energy to the band’s live show.</p>

                <p>You can catch us touring mostly in the midwest, especially in Wisconsin and Minnesota. We love to play house
                    parties and are okay with being paid in beer and pizza. Be sure to keep up to date with our new releases
                    and shows as we maintain this page!</p>

                <p>Yearless is currently preparing for their second release, which is diving further into the darker, more technical
                    side of pop punk. Stay tuned for more information on future releases and projects.</p>
