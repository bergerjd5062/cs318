                <h2>Yearless Band</h2>
                <p>Birthed from the ashes of the prostate exam of pop punk, Pets With People Names, Yearless is here to make you sad,
                    so very, very sad.</p>
                <p>Vocalist Anthony Hagan, guitarist Chris Littlejohn and drummer Nik Zanter founded Yearless after member changes shook
                    up the lineup of their once beloved Pets With People Names. The band decided they wanted to take a more aggressive
                    approach to pop punk, citing influences such as Knuckle Puck and The Story So Far, and decided that, although
                    not a complete 180,a name change was in order. After a short search, the trio found guitarist Jacob “Moose” Seemuth,
                    and completed their transformation.</p>
        
                <p>The band released their first EP, This House Makes Me Homesick, under their new name in October 2017 and has been
                    picking up steam ever since. In early 2018, Jake Smith assumed his role as bassist, and Hagan moved strictly
                    to vocals, allowing him to create a more “unique” energy to the band’s live show.</p>
        
                <p>Yearless is currently preparing for their second release, which is diving further into the darker, more technical
                    side of pop punk. Stay tuned for more information on future releases and projects</p>
